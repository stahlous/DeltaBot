Congratulations; you've earned your first ∆!

As you may already know, a ∆ is given when a comment has changed someone's view. For a more detailed explanation of the ∆ system, [see here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltabot).

/u/DeltaBot has updated your user flair and created [your own wiki page](/r/{{ config.subreddit }}/wiki/user/{{ awardee }}) which will be updated every time you earn a delta. If you do well, you may find yourself on our [leaderboards](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/leaderboards) (the monthly one is also featured in our sidebar).

Good luck, and happy CMVing!
